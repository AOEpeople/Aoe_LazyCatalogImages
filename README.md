# Aoe_LazyCatalogImages Magento Module

This module (LCI) is meant to provide URLs for images that contain enough information to render the image at a later point in time.
The current system pre-renders images and front-loads that overhead into the initial page render process.
Additionally, if the image cache is flushed and a page is cached with the old URL, then images will be broken.
LCI changes all URLs generated by the catalog/image helper to contain the full set of parameters to build an image and signs the 
parameters with a SHA265 hash to prevent tampering by end-users.

The actual rendering of the images is handled via the /get.php and /media/.htaccess combo. 
The .htaccess file will rewrite requests for non-existent files to be serviced by /get.php which is the entry point for database backed file storage.
LCI hijacks the `loadByFilename` method to check if the requested file is actually a token that should be processed.
At the early stage of token decoding a failure results in a fall-through to the database storage code.
At later stages, after the token is decoded, a failure results in a redirect to a placeholder image.

## Compatability
* Model Rewrites
    * core/file_storage_database
* Helper Rewrites
    * catalog/image
* Module Dependencies
    * Mage_Core
    * Mage_Catalog
* Additional Requirements
    * /get.php
    * /media/.htaccess (or equivalent setup)
        * This is just to redirect requests for missing images to the /get.php handler
        
## TODO
* Add unit tests
* Change to locally cached image filename to match the URL filename so Apache (or whatever) can directly serve the image on future requests
* Add admin config for cache age and enable/disable
* Research a better way of intercepting image requests than using database storage classes
