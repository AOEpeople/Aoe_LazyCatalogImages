# Aoe_LazyCatalogImages Magento Module

This module (LCI) is meant to provide URLs for images that contain enough information to render the image at a later point in time.
The current system pre-renders images and front-loads that overhead into the initial page render process.
Additionally, if the image cache is flushed and a page is cached with the old image URLs, then the images will be broken.
LCI changes all URLs generated by the catalog/image helper to contain the full set of parameters to build an image and signs the 
parameters with a SHA265 hash to prevent tampering by end-users.

The actual rendering of the images is handled via the /lci.php and /media/catalog/product/LCI/.htaccess combo.
The .htaccess file will rewrite requests for non-existent files to be serviced by /lci.php.
The entrypoint, lci.php, checks if the requested file is actually a token that should be processed.
At the early stage of token decoding a failure results in a 404 response.
At later stages, after the token is decoded, a failure results in a redirect to a placeholder image.
